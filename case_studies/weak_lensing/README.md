Gravitational lensing is an important probe of the large-scale structure of the universe, as it allows astronomers and physicists to create mass maps reflecting the distribution of dark matter across the sky. However, weak lensing, the most prevalent form of lensing, is difficult for the human eye to discern in astronomical images. We propose a novel method for simultaneously estimating shear and convergence, two weak lensing observables, from images using neural posterior estimation. After experimentation, we conclude that the current model architecture is suitable for learning complex spatial patterns of shear and convergence, but has trouble producing estimates on the correct scale.
