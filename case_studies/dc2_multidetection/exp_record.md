## DC2 Multidetection Experiment Record

### 07-30

1. run with postprocessing

2. run with postprocessing

### 07-31

1. run with postprocessing (choose topk = 1)

(hereafter, in postprocessing, we always use topk = 1)


### 08-05

1. increase the channels in catalognet to 512, and fix the output sources to 3 per tile (topk = 2)

2. increase the channels in catalognet to 512, and fix the output sources to 5 per tile (topk = 3)

3. keep the channels in catalognet to be 256, and fix the output sources to 3 per tile (topk = 2)

(find channel is not important)

4. test 8 sources per tile (topk = 3)

5. test 8 sources per tile (topk = 5)
