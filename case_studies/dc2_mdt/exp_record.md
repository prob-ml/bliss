(due to a bug in code, the previous exp about mdt are all invalid)

### 04-12 (mdt)

1. train a basic mdt

### 04-12 (simple_net)

2. train a basic simple net
3. pred velocity


### 04-14 (great_lake)

1. mdt
(these simple_nets are trained to predict velocity, so the loss is high)
2. simple_net
3. simple_net_speed
4. simple_ar_net
5. simple_cond_true_net

### 04-14 (simple_net)

(these simple_nets are trained to predict velocity, so the loss is high)
1. train a basic simple net (batch_size: 128)
2. train a basic simple net (batch_size: 64)

3. traina basic sample net (batch_size: 128) pred noise
