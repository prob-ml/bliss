# Introduction

BLISS is a Bayesian method for deblending and cataloging light sources. BLISS provides
  - __Accurate estimation__ of parameters in blended field.
  - __Calibrated uncertainties__ through fitting an approximate Bayesian posterior.
  - __Scalability__ of Bayesian inference to entire astronomical surveys.

BLISS uses state-of-the-art variational inference techniques including
  - __Amortized inference__, in which a neural network maps telescope images to an approximate Bayesian posterior on parameters of interest.
  - __Variational auto-encoders__ (VAEs) to fit a flexible model for galaxy morphology and deblend galaxies.
  - __Wake-sleep algorithm__ to jointly fit the approximate posterior and model parameters such as the PSF and the galaxy VAE.

# Installation

1. To use and install `bliss` you first need to install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

2. Then, install the [fftw](http://www.fftw.org) library (which is used by `galsim`). With Ubuntu you can install it by running
```
sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev
```

3. Install git-lfs if you haven't already installed it for another project
```
git-lfs install
```

4. Now download the bliss repo and fetch some pre-trained models and test data from git-lfs
```
git clone https://github.com/prob-ml/bliss.git
```

5. To create a poetry environment with the `bliss` dependencies satisified, run
```
cd bliss
poetry install
poetry shell
```

6. Finally, verify that bliss is installed correctly by running the tests both on your CPU (default) and on your GPU:
```
pytest
pytest --gpu
```

# Latest updates
### Galaxies
   - BLISS now includes a galaxy model based on a VAE that was trained on Galsim galaxies.
   - BLISS now includes an algorithm for detecting, measuring, and deblending galaxies.

### Stars
   - BLISS already includes the StarNet functionality from its predecessor repo: [DeblendingStarFields](https://github.com/Runjing-Liu120/DeblendingStarfields).
